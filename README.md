# UNET
UNET PyTorch

UNET is an architecture developed by Olaf Ronneberger for Biomedical Image Segmentation in 2015 at the University of Freiburg, Germany. It is one of the most popularly used approaches in any image segmentation task today. The great thing about the UNET architecture is that it does not require many training samples to learn. UNET is a U-shaped encoder-decoder network architecture, which consists of four encoder blocks and four decoder blocks that are connected through skip connections.
